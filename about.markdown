Hi, I'm Michael. I'm a ~~programmer~~ ~~engineer~~ builder. Simply put, my passion is to build things that people love. I started building web applications as a kid, studied CS at Duke, and, most recently, spent 6 years helping to build [Plaid][1]. 

Now I'm figuring out what's next. This blog is meant to help me do just that. 

Thanks for stopping by.
